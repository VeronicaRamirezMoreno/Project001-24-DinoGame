# Dino Run: A Classic Browser Game

## Introduction
Welcome to Dino Run, a simple yet engaging browser-based game inspired by the famous Chrome Dinosaur game. This project is my first endeavor post-bootcamp, showcasing my skills in JavaScript, CSS, and DOM manipulation. The game offers a nostalgic trip to the classic Chrome offline entertainment, now accessible anytime online.
